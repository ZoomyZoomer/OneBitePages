OneBitePages is a fullstack public blogsite that uses MongoDB and Nodejs to actively keep track and update posts made by users.

How To Run:

- Copy the repository
- cd blogsite
- npm run dev
- cd ../api
- nodemon index.js (in a command prompt terminal)

Open up the localhost link given to you by npm run dev and the blogsite should be live!
You'll be able to see other users' posts that have also downloaded the repository and created accounts!

**If you're experiencing CORS issues, please update line 20 of index.js with the correct port of localhost (Ex: localhost:5174)**
